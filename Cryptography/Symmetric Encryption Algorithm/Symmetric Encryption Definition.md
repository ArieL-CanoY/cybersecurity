```python
- Uses two keys for both encryption and decryption
	- Keys are public and private
		- Encrypt data with private key and decrypt it with public key or vice versa.
- The size of cipher text is the same or smaller than the original plain text.
- The encryption process is very fast.
- It is used when a large amount of data is required to transfer.
- It only provides confidentiality.
- The length of key used is 128 or 256 bits
- In symmetric key encryption, resource utilization is low as compared to asymmetric key encryption.
- It is efficient as it is used for handling large amount of data.
- Security is less as only one key is used for both encryption and decryption purpose.
- Examples: 3DES, AES, DES and RC4
