```python
- Uses single key for both encryption and decryption
- The size of cipher text is the same or larger than the original plain text.
- The encryption process is slow.
- It is used to transfer small amounts of data.
- It provides confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation.
- The Â length of key used is 2048 or higher
- In asymmetric key encryption, resource utilization is high.
- It is comparatively less efficient as it can handle a small amount of data.
- It is more secure as two keys are used here- one for encryption and the other for decryption.
- Examples: Diffie-Hellman, ECC, El Gamal, DSA and RSA|
