- stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- It is a list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.
- Its primary goal is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with this standard identifier.
- Each CVE entry is assigned a unique identifier in the format CVE-[Year]-[Number generated by CNA (CVE Numbering Authorities)], such as CVE-2024-12345. This identifier makes it easy to reference and search for specific vulnerabilities.
- typically the format is:
	[problem type] in [product/version] causes [impact] when [attack]
- A CVE entry typically includes a brief description of the vulnerability or exposure, references to related security advisories or reports, and sometimes details about the affected software and potential impact.
- CVE identifiers are used by security professionals, software vendors, and researchers to share information about vulnerabilities. They are crucial for vulnerability management, as they help in tracking and mitigating security issues.
- By standardizing the identification of vulnerabilities, the CVE system helps in improving security by enabling more efficient communication and coordination among different entities involved in cybersecurity
