# Definition
```python
>> Injection attacks occur when developers fail to sanitize user input properly.
```



# Examples
```python
>> bypassing NoSQL database authentication by performing operator attacks such as $ne, $regex, etc

>> typical injection attacks: error-based, boolean-based, time-based, blind.


>> JSON keys can be injected or bypass
```



# Defenses
```python
>> Perform input validation and proper sanitization for all input.

>> Use proper filtering to limit the amount of information in the responses to prevent data leaks.

>> Never trust your API consumers, even if internal

>> Strictly define all input data: schemas, types, string patterns

>> Enforce inpit limitations at runtime

>> Validate, filter, sanitize all incoming data

>> Define, limit, and enforce API outputs to prevent data leaks
```
