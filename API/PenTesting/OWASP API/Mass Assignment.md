# Definition
```python
>> When APIs expose resources or variables, attackers can use these to craft their requests and calls to access resources they aren't supposed to.
```


# Example
```python
>> you check your profile and it receives some json data with:
{
 otherdata...
 "isAdmin": "false"
}

>> when accessing sensitive data, you pass that key and change it with a true value that can lead to unauthorized access of sensitive data:

GET /sensitiveData(admin_dashboard)
{
	"auth": "d56352ce4f0166c8d85c6d1f87b17f38eff3f22766ee8dcb824aa3d8f7cbd8b1"
	"isAdmin": "true"
}
```




# Defenses
```python
>> Avoid exposing internal variables or object names as input.

>> Approve properties that the client can update.
```
