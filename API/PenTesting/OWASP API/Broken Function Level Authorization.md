# Definition
```python
>> BFLA attacks are similar to BOLA or IDOR attacks

>> BFLA attacks focuses on exploiting the roles and access used in the API.
```


# Examples
```python
>> HTTP Request:
	GET /api/users/financial_info

	Attacker can change the users to admins
	GET /api/admins/financial_info



```



# Defenses
```python
>> Avoid function-level authorization.

>> Deny all access by default.

>> Only allow authorize users to the appropriate groups or roles.

>> Do not rely on app to enforce admin access

>> Only allow operation to authorize users that belong to the appropriate group or role

>> Properly design and perform test authorization.
