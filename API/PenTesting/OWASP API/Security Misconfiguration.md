# Definition
```python
>> Misconfigured security settings in APIs or applications can lead to attackers exploiting those vulnerable settings to exploit the application.
```


# Examples
```python
>> Unencrypted communication

>> Unpatch or outdated services or plugins

>> Unprotected files

>> Misconfigured CORS policies

>> Lack of control of Content-Type HTTP header content

>> Does not validate crafted header leading to injection

>> Verbose messages

>> Error not properly handled
```


# Defenses
```python
>> Establish and practice hardening and patching procedures.

>> Disable unnecessary applications and features.

>> Restrict administrative access / practice least privilege

>> Regularly test for security misconfigurations using scanning tools and manual testing.

>> Define and enforce all outputs including errors

```
