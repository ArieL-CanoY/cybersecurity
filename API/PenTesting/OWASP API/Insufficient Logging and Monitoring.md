```python
>> Without proper logging and monitoring, attacks can go unnoticed.

>> The organization will never identify if they are being attack or not.
```



# Examples
```python



```



# Defenses
```python
>> Use standard formats to monitor and log APIs like API Gateways

>> Log input validation failures, failed authentication attempts, denied access, etc...

>> Keep your logs protected like sensitive data

>> Monitor your API endpoints across all phases (production, stage, test, dev). React to security issues identified within your API.

>> Avoid sensitive data in logs
