```python
>> Without proper logging and monitoring, attacks can go unnoticed.

>> The organization will never identify if they are being attack or not.
```



# Examples
```python
>> cannot find specific ways of how an organization data breached because of no logs or monitoring.



```



# Defenses
```python
>> Use standard formats to monitor and log APIs like API Gateways

>> Log input validation failures, failed authentication attempts, denied access, etc...

>> Keep your logs protected like sensitive data

>> Monitor your API endpoints across all phases (production, stage, test, dev). React to security issues identified within your API.

>> Ensure that logs are formatted to be consumable by other tools

>> Include enough detail to identify attackers

>> Avoid having sensitive data in logs - If you need the information for debugging purposes, redact it partially.

>> Integrate with SIEMS and other dashboards, monitoring, alerting tools
