# Vulnerabilities
```python
>> Poor implementation of authentication methods.

>> Sensitive authentication details like auth tokens and passwords in URL

>> Misconfigured JWT ({"alg":"NONE"})

>> The app permits weak passwords and/or encryption keys
```


# Defenses
```python
>> Check all possible ways and secure methods to authenticate to all APIs

>> Password reset APIs and one-time links also allow users to get authenticated and should be protected just as seriously

>> Use standard authentication, token generation, password storage, MFA, Captchas.

>> Use short-lived or temporary access tokens

>> Authenticate your apps (so you know who is talking to you)

>> OAuth token is not authentication (hotel key analogy)

>> Use stricter rate-limiting for authentication, implement lockout policies and weak password checks
