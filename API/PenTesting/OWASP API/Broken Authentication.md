# Vulnerabilities
```python
>> Poor implementation of authentication methods.

>> Sensitive authentication details like auth tokens and passwords in URL

>> Misconfigured JWT ({"alg":"NONE"})

>> The app permits weak passwords and/or encryption keys
```


# Defenses
```python
>> Use secure methods to authenticate to APIs.

>> Consider using Multi-Factor Authentication and Captchas.

>> Use temporary access tokens.

>> Use strict rate-limiting for authentication and implement lockout policies.
