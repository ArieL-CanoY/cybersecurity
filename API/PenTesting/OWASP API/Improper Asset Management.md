# Definition
```python
>> Non-production or earlier versions of an API that are still in use and/or not as well protected as the production or current API are potential targets for attackers.
```

# Example
```python
>> old API endpoint can leverage by an attacker and try to test its security 

```

# Defenses
```python
>> Perform regular security reviews of all APIs

>> Keep up-to-date inventory of all API hosts.

>> Limit access to anything that should not be public like documentation.

>> Limit access to production data. Segregate access to production and non-production data.

>> Implement additional external controls such as API firewalls

>> Properly retire old versions or backport security fixes

>> Implement strict authentication, redirects, CORS, etc.
