# Definition
```python
>> APIs can expose too much data.

>> Excessive data exposure can result in attackers using those extra details to gather information they should not have or use it to formulate a more sophisticated attack.
```


# Examples
```python
>> Too much error message shown that can expose data to be exploited or leverage.

>> Debug log or error options are enabled from the server.




```


# Defenses
```python
>> Filter data of all API responses, including error responses

>> Limit the exposure of sensitive data or Personally

>> Never rely on client to filter sensitive data

>> Review all responses, only return what the API consumers really need

>> Define schemas of all the API responses

>> Do not forget about error responses

>> Identify all the sensitive or Pll info and justify its use

>> Enforce response checks to prevent accidental data and exception leaks
