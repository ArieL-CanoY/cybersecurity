# Definition
```python
>> APIs can expose too much data.

>> Excessive data exposure can result in attackers using those extra details to gather information they should not have or use it to formulate a more sophisticated attack.
```



# Defenses
```python
>> Filter data of all API responses, including error responses

>> Limit the exposure of sensitive data or Personally

>> Identifiable Information (PII).

>> Enforce response checks to prevent accidental leaks of data or exceptions.

>> NEVER rely on client side to filter sensitive data!!!
