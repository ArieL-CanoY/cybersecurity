# Approach
```python
>> API Documentation
	- look for endpoints, response, parameters, etc.

>> Create a Postman collection for different API endpoints and HTTP request

>> Decide Scope
	- Additional attack surface (v1, v2, etc.)

>> OWASP API Top 10
	
>> Tools
	- Burp
	- Postman
```




# Test Cases
```python
>> Look for abnormal HTTP headers

>> Authentication
	 - most API endpoints should have authentication mechanism especially when creating, updating, and deleting data. Viewing sensitive information should also be authenticated.
	- check for custom authentication

>> Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
	- guessable values are directly reference to an object that might shown sensitive information.

>> Server-Side Request Forger (SSRF)
	- able to request to unintended location.

>> XML (Extensible Markup Language) Attacks
	- try to change JSON to XML, if it accepts it then try XXE Attack.

>> Denial Of Service (DOS)
	- check for throttling enable or request limit for specific time.

>> Injection Attacks
	- SQL, NoSQL





```



# Vulnerability Scanners
```python
>> W3af
>> Astra
>> FuzzAPI
>> Vookie
```

### Other 
```python
>> cURL
>> JWT.io
>> Burp Extensions: Autorize, JWT Attacker, Turbo Intruder, Auto Repeater
>> SQLMap
>> Fuzzing Wordlists: SecLists, fuzzdb, api_wordlist, etc.
```


```python
Before You Start...
>> Collect any Documentation or Notes on the target APIs
>> Gather any user tokens/accounts needed
>> Come up w/ a Testing Methodology
>> P.O.I.S.E.D. or S.T.R.I.D.E Methodologies are a good example

```


```python
>> remove some parameters
>> add some parameters
>> change the data format - ex. JSON to XML or vice versa
>> see response when you are authenticated and unauthenticated 
>> error handling
>> manipulta data, like CRUD - check response
```
