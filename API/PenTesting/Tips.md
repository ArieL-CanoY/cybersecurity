```python
>> Read / Explore API documentation if it is available:
	>>> What is the API's purpose? Ask questions about the intended uses and what applications are currently using the API (if any).
	>>> Are there Flowcharts or diagrams available

>> Observe each parameter in every module of API, understand how the data is transferred from source to destination. Try to play with the parameter by tampering them.

>> Test Each HTTP Method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
	>>> Pay Attention to the Headers
	>>> Pay Attention to the Responses
	>>> Error Handling (Exception, Error messages being used)
```


# Q&A
```python

- Never done SOAPUI
- Most API use REST
- Manual first before using automation tools
- pentestmoneyk website
- no sequence of test, test only depending on the context, response of the server, and the purpose of API.
