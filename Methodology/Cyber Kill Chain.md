# Definition
```python
- concept developed by Lockheed Martin, outlining the stages of cyberattack. 
- A framework designed to help organizations understand and defend against cyber threats more effectively. 
- the concept is based on military strategies and adopted in cybersecurity purposes.
- the stages typically include:
	- reconnaissance
	- weaponization
	- delivery
	- exploitation
	- installation
	- command and control (c2)
	- actions on objectives
```




# 7 stages of Cyber Kill Chain
```python
1. Recon
	 Recon, short for reconnaissance, refers to the step where the attacker tries to learn as much as possible about the target. Information such as the types of servers, operating system, IP addresses, names of users, and email addresses, can help the attack’s success.

2. Weaponization
	 This step refers to preparing a file with a malicious component, for example, to provide the attacker with remote access.

3. Delivery
	 Delivery means delivering the “weaponized” file to the target via any feasible method, such as email or USB flash memory.

4. Exploitation
	 When the user opens the malicious file, their system executes the malicious component.

5. Installation
	 The previous step should install the malware on the target system.

6. Command & Control (C2)
	 The successful installation of the malware provides the attacker with a command and control ability over the target system.

7. Actions on Objectives
	 After gaining control over one target system, the attacker has achieved their objectives. One example objective is Data Exfiltration (stealing target’s data).
