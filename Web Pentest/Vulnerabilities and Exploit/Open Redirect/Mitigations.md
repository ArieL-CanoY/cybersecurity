## Remove the parameter
```python
@snyk
- This is the safest way to fix the open redirect but depending on how your application is set up, it could disrupt the flow of the application and impact the user’s experience. If the user was trying to access a different page, such as the contact details, the user would have to navigate from their profile to the contact details instead of the app redirecting them straight to the contact details.
```


## Implement an allow list
```python
@snyk
- If removing the parameter doesn’t work for your application flow, then we could alter the code to only allow redirects to pages from an “allow list”. All redirect_url parameters that are not equal to either the profile or contact details page will simply redirect the user to the home page after login.
```


## Implement a fixed domain
```python
@snyk
- Alternatively, if your application contains many potential legitimate pages to redirect to, we implement a fixed domain and simply append the redirected page.
	Code:
		redirect('www.mywebsite.com/' + userSuppliedRedirectPage)

	URL:
		www.mywebsite.com/login?redirect=home

```


## Mobile User Beware
```python
@snyk
- Most mobile devices will only show the domain of the site you’re visiting and will exclude any parameters, including redirections. This makes it very tricky for mobile users to spot a malicious redirect.
