# Primary Defense
```python
>> use CSRF token in relevant requests.
	- unpredictable with high randomness
	- tied to user's session and not pool
		- if pool then attacker can use their token to send with the target user
	- validate a token for specific user before execute their request
	- do not store in cookie, it can be bypass because it automatically sent it once you visit specific website that has a cookie stored to local computer.
```


# Additional Defense
```python
- Use SameSite cookies
```
Refer to this: [[SameSite Cookie]]



# Inadequate Defense
```python
- Use of Referer Header - can be bypass
```
