```python
- do not allow the user to call the operating system on the server as much as possible, use alternative like an API.
- validate the user input if not possible to avoid calling the OS with whitelist of permitted values.
- if the server have the service like nslookup or any services that the user input should provide arbritary specific input, validate the input using Regular Expression (RegEx)

```


##### own recommendation for some specific function
```python
- instead of sanitizing and validating the input, use conditional for specific 

- use conditional like this:

if userInput == value1:
	do something
else useInput == value2:
	do something
...
else:
	Throw an error
```
