# General
```python
- always treat the user input as string or value rather than an operator or part of the query



```


# Login
```python
- use findOne to return only 1 object, this is similar to limit 1 in SQL query, this will limit the damage than can be done when the application is vulnerable to NoSQLi
```



# Search
```python
- same as in general, convert it to string or validate if the user input is only a number or in whitelist
- avoid dangerous operators such as $where, $mapreduce, and $group
```
