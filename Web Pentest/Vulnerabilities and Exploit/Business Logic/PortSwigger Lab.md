Excessive trust in client-side controls

     - client-side computation is bad practice because like in the lab, adding items to cart with client-side controls can change the price of an item

  

  

-------------Failing to Handle unconventional input---------

  

High-level Logic Vulnerability

     - creating unintentional use of application can lead to exploit like in the lab, allowing the cart to have negative quantity item and adding other item with positive quantity and purchasing with right amount of bill is vulnerable.

  

Low-level logic flaw

     - if sending negative quantity of items, sending tons of quantity will break the permitted integer in the back-end programming language from  2,147,483,647 and it will reach the maximum amount and it will go back to negative amount

  

Inconsistent Handling of exceptional input

     - if the employee is has a higher privilege while using some domain like @higher.com, and the normal user can only use @lower.com, you can gain higher privilege just by inputting the normal user domain/email together with employees domain but the last domain it will get is exactly right about the employees domain like  "yourname@higher.com.lower.com". If the input has a limit of only getting the first 20 character, you can try an email like this to gain higher privilege "abcdefghi@higher.com.lower.com", because it only gets the 20 character, the application will read this "abcdefghi@higher.com" and the lower.com sub-domain will ignore. Therefore you can be registered as an employee even though you are normal user. 

  

-------Making flawed assumptions about the user behavior---------------

-------Trusted users won't remain trustworthy------------------------------

  

Inconsistent Security Controls

     - allow a user to have a higher privilege if their identity like information of others is the same

     - in the lab, users can have access if their email address have the same with the admin email address like their mail server and domain like this @gmail.com. gmail is mail server and .com is domain 

  

  

--------Users won't always supply mandatory input-------------

  

Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint

     - updating the password and removing the parameter "current password" will bypass the confirmation if the user is really who they are trying to update the password of the account

  

  

--------Users won't always follow the intended sequence----------

  

2FA simple bypass

     - after the verification email appear, go to the home page where and sometimes the application did not look for this bypass

  

Insufficient work flow validation

     - adding expensive items on cart before confirming to purchase affordable items can bypass insufficient funds logic 

  

Authentication bypass via flawed state machine 

     - bypassing the next step verification by manipulating the get request http header to get the home page instead of verification page

  

--------Domain Specific flaws-----------------------

Flawed Enforcement of Business Rules

     - applying things that can change the value of something can be exploit like this lab, having 2 coupons and applying it alternately can bypass the "The coupon is already use" feature of the program
