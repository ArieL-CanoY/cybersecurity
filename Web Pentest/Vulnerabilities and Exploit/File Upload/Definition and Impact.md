File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.

In some cases, the act of uploading the file is in itself enough to cause damage. Other attacks may involve a follow-up HTTP request for the file, typically to trigger its execution by the server.

# Impact
```python
- Remote Code Execution - an attacker can upload php file with code of calling operating system to execute commands.
- Phishing Pages
- Denial of Service - if the web app does not validate the file size, an attacker can flood the server with huge amount of files. It can also by overwriting files and by using RCE, an attacker can remove files.
- overwrite an existing file on a system (config, sensitive files, etc.)
- when malicious file upload to the server, the user retrieves it, it can use to execute commands on client-side which can use to trigger CSRF and XSS targetting users.
