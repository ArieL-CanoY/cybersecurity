```bash
Notes:

     X-Forwarded-For: [different ip address] - used when website block log in attempts

  

  

---------------------------------------Vulnerabilities in password-based login--------------------------------------------------------

Username enumeration via different responses

     - logging in different username can know if it is valid if the response of the website is telling the only incorrect is password

  

Username enumeration via subtly different responses

     - logging in different username with not obvious response or change in the response

  

Username enumeration via response timing

     - most of the time, submitting a valid credentials has a different time response 

  

Broken brute-force protection, IP block

     - knowing a username and brute-forcing its password can block you from attempting to log in again for several minutes. It can bypass by alternating log in to your valid account and then brute forcing others account.

  

Username enumeration via account lock

     - brute-forcing username with multiple attempts of log in sometimes websites block these account, by these it can gather information that the account or that username is valid.

  

  

  

------------------------------Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication--------------------------------------

2 Factor Authentication Bypass

     - some websites can bypass 2FA when entered a valid password, just go to profile or any page of the website after the 2FA prompted

  

Password reset broken logic

     - an attacker can change the username when changing the password of your account by intercepting the http request

  

  

  

  

PORTSWIGGER LABS TAKING TOO MUCH OF MY TIME BECAUSE OF BRUTE FORCING WHILE USING COMMUNITY EDITION THAT LIMIT THE REQUEST PER SECOND THAT CAN TAKE HOUR SO THIS IS THE END OF THE NOTE
