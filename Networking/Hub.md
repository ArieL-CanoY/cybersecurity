 - used to connect devices in a local network
- it repeats the message to all other ports except the source port
- old networking devices and should be replaced with a new device called "switch" 
- it use bandwidth a lot because it sends data on all port
- uses half duplex, means it can only send and received one at a time, otherwise the data will be corrupted
- Layer 1 Device
- 1 Collision Domain
- Using this will have a security risk that other device on the network can intercept or steal  or get the message which is not destined to them
