- stands for Virtual Local Area Network
- This will separate the broadcast of other devices to other devices in a single switch
- can used separate the communication of devices connected to a single switch
- every interfaces are assigned to VLAN 1 (default) which all devices can communicate to each other
- you can add up to 4094 VLAN
- you can add other VLAN switch but the problem is only assigned VLAN can only communicate with other VLAN switch. The solution is by using Trunk
- Trunk is use to communicate with other VLAN using multiple VLAN in a single port. So it is like a port with multiple VLAN especially used to connect multiple networking devices with VLAN.
