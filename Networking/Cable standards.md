note: cat. 5 means category 5

Example: 10 BASE - T
- 10 - maximum speed
- BASE - baseband transmission
- T - twisted pair cable


# 10 BASE - 2
- thin Ethernet
- uses coaxial cable
- maximum speed of 10Mbps
- maximum length of 200 meters

# 100 BASE - T
- maximum speed of 100 Mbps
- uses UTP cat. 5 or higher
- maximum length of 100 meters
- also known as fast ethernet


# 100 BASE - FX
- maximum speed of 100 Mbps
- uses fiber optic cable
- maximum length of 400 meters (half duplex)
- maximum length of 2 kilometers (full duplex   )


# 1000 BASE - T
- maximum speed of 1000 Mbps
- uses UTP cat. 5 or higher
- maximum length of 100 meters


# 1000 BASE - TX
- maximum speed of 1000 Mbps
- uses UTP cat. 5 or higher
- maximum length of 100 meters
- supposed to be an easier setup because it only uses 2 unidirectional pairs of wires for communication
- never caught on. Known as a failure in commercial implementation


# 10G BASE - T
- maximum speed of 10,000 Mbps
- uses both STP and UTP cabling
- max length of 55 meters (cat 6)
- max length of 100 meters (cat 6a)


# 10G BASE - SR
- max speed of 10k Mbps
- SR for short range
- commonly used standard multimode fiber specification
- max length of 300 meters

# 10G BASE - ER
- max speed of 10k Mbps
- ER for extended reach
- max length of 40 kilometers using single mode fiber

# 10G BASE - SW
- same as 10G BASE - SR
- specifically used to operate over SONET - Synchronous Optical Network
