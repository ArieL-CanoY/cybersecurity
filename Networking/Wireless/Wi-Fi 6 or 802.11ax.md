- was created to make a wi-fi network perform better when a lot of devices are connected
- OFDMA - Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access
	- a technology that lowers latency and delivers data to multiple devices more efficiently
	- delivers signal to all devices connected all at once
- support MU-MIMO - check [[SU and MU MIMO]]
- Wi-Fi 5 vs Wi-Fi 6 MU-MIMO
	- Wi-Fi 5
		- only available in download
		- can only support 4 simultaneous streams
	- Wi-Fi 6
		-  available in both upload and download
		- can support up to 12 simultaneously streams
- BSS - Basic Service Set coloring
	- colors or marks networks so they can be distinguished from one another
- has latest security protocol which is WPA
- TWT - Target Wake Time
	- the Wi-Fi router schedule of time of when the data is received, while the devices are sending and receiving, their antennas are on, but this technology scheduled a time and turn their antennas off which saves devices' battery
- Wi-Fi 6E routers will broadcast 3 separate bands and these are:
	- 2.4 GHz
	- 5 GHz
	- 6 GHz
