- wiring standards developed by TIA/EIA
- defines the rules on how twisted pair cables should be wired to RJ-45

# Straight cable
- both ends are wired using the same standard
- most common type of cable and it is used to connect computer to hubs, switches, or modems.
- Ex. 568A to 568A 

# Cross-over cable
- each end is wired using the 2 different (opposite) standards
- used to connect 2 similar devices together
- Ex. 568B to 568A



# Rollover cable
- both ends are wired completely opposite of each other 
- used to connect a computer or terminal to a router's console port  


# Coaxial cable
- used primarily by cable providers to provide a computer with broadband internet connection
- early on it was used as the backbone for networks such as bus network 
- 2 types:
	- RG-6 - made for long distances and commonly used for cable television and internet connection
	- RG-59 - made for short distances and generally used for HD/HQ video


# Fiber Optic cable
- uses pulses of light to send data
- 2 modes:
	- Single Mode Fiber
		- light only enters at a single angle
		- made for long distances
	- Multi Mode Fiber 
		- light reflects off the walls of the cable
		- made for short distances
