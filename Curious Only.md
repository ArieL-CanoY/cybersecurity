is hotspot connection will slow if the source of connection is in low power mode
```python
- based on chatgpt, yes:
	- it reduce processing power
	- some devices reduce network speed when in low power mode
	- if the device manage heat better, it indicates that it lowers the CPU and other components, which can affect overall performance, including hotspot functionality.
```


thought
```python
- what if we used ngrok for reverse shell
- HTTP 302 vs 307
```
