practice, practice, practice, ctf, be passionate, 



how to improve:
- repeated attempts with feedback
- valid environment
- timely feedback
- don't get too comfortable - practice at the edge of your ability, pushing beyond comfort zone
	- deliberate practice 

	- expertise comes from recognition
	- recognition comes from thousands of hours of practice


pen testing is not the right for you if:
- you are for the money
- you easily complacent or not like to study
- you cannot write and communicate technical and non-technical reports



path of pen testing
- computer basics - A+
- computer network 
- linux essentials - overthewire
- security fundamentals - tryhackme, picoctf, attackiqacademy, blueteamlabs, cisco cybersec
- read code/exploit, automate things - python essential - cisco, powershell - microsoft training
- cloud technology - aws, azure, google
- start hacking - tryhackme, hackthebox, hackers-arise, gbhackers, hacker101, vulnhub
- YT - tcm, hackersploit, 




cyberspatial:
- VM
- Command Line
- System Administration
- Computer Networking
- Personal Digital Security


how to build discipline:
- set clear goal (addition: and attainable goal - short-term goal, to build future goal - long-term goal)
- develop a routine
- embrace hardship
- art of mindfulness
- practice meditation
- plan and adapt
- simplicity and efficiency
- embrace fear
- develop mental resilience
- record your experiences
- live by code - ethical rules
- cultivate patience
- embrace the path of continuous improvement
- share your knowledge



Mindset of Successful Programmers
- focus of practice not theory - 10k hours of practice not theory
- ego is the enemy
- get comfortable being uncomfortable - change i can't do --> i can learn to do it
- you will never be a master, but being a student is so much better


ThePrimeTime - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZkbDCSdC1Q&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime
- train for the position you want to be, not where you at
- learn, learn, learn
- struggle to grow
- dive deep into different topic(go out comfort zone)
- ex. if you use github client, use the command line for git
- muscles get weak if you dont use them
- 





- information is all over from the internet - online courses, certifications, research, youtube
- keep pushing where you want to be by learning every single day even 1 hour a day dedicated only for learning something




neal bridges cybersec tips
- more on hands-on
- networking -linkendin
- do the free stuff first before paid
- chase knowledge not certs
- take your interested, then figure out what you dont know (this will work in some cases)
	- example you want to know pentesting and you have 0 knowledge, you come up with the topic of computer networking, then dive to that topic first before moving on the that pentesting, therefore, filling the gaps (this is only applicable when you are in the field I guess because you do not want to know all the topic of linux, windows, networks, security just to get started).
	- But mostly says learn computer networking first, linux, windows, etc. before pentesting which is more good idea


- in any pentesting, preparation is key:
	- what you bring in your bag when you go for an onsite pentest - OSINT is important



https://danielmiessler.com/p/your-value-comes-from-your-output/



- have a solid foundational skills - networking, linux, windows, scripting, system administration
- expect lower compensation 
- you do not need to know everything before landing the job





sir andrex from PITSF
If you don't have skills nor experience, I would start with Fundamental Skills / Experience muna (Networking, Linux, Security Ops etc) If you have skills (ibig sabihin you are actively doing pentesting or threat hunting) pero don't have real work experience. Focus on getting work first before dwelling sa training since you have intermediate or potentially advance skill. Pero to be honest Blue Team and Red Team are WAY ABOVE INTERMEDIATE skills sa Cybersecurity. Your focus is to get a SOC role, or Help Desk roles before you can even think of landing a Blue Team and Red Team role. Focus on you short term objective before and slowly work on you long term objective. Good luck









chatgpt tips:
To transition into a career as a penetration tester in the cybersecurity field, you should start with a solid foundation in IT and cybersecurity, focusing on networking, operating systems, and programming. As you progress, you'll need to develop specialized skills in penetration testing methodologies and tools. Continuous learning, certifications, and hands-on experience are crucial.

**Detailed Part:**

- view certs as character to learn more outside their work
- you cannot be a good red teamer if you do not know how blue teamer's job
- build endurance
- run recon 1 by 1 to analyze slowly and get a useful information
- relating something you know other than security to security 
- best way to find a job is to put yourself out there (online)
- knowing what you dont know
- if you want to start something, just get into it
- you built this roadmap but you did not read a single thing about that? just start
- you will definitely struggle a lot in offensive security
- start is hard, but consistently doing it will make it easier, you will not notice it until few months and you'll be surprise how you progress
- nmap
- run recon on the bg
- 3 tools - python, any tools, if you want to go from A to Z, you can try AKL...Z, ABC...Z. YABG...Z
- when writing reports, write also the defenses that did very well that blocks you attacks
- challenging - learning curve, constantly learning 
- find what motivates you
- in everything in life, consistency makes perfect, sticking with it and make it routine then you will like and improve it
- if you want to achieve to be on the field of CyberSec, stick to schedule and set some goals, do not go like i wanna get OSCP, but is attainable and measure - means short-term for long-term. do it not based on completion but in measurable. just set small attainable goals 
- learn how to troubleshoot, research and multitask effectively 
- memorization and flow charts are not enough
- very rarely an exploit or technology is fully unique
- everything relates to something...somehow
- detect the technique not the exploit or the tool
-

- success is built upon a mount of failure
- in getting certification, learning aspect is more valuable
- focus on small wins, don't focus on the end result
- don't memorize, take notes
- learn cybersec as professional - trust the process, don't rely just only in motivation
- learn pentesting slowly
- how much javascript to learn as pentester - it really depends what you're doing as pentester 
- only learn what you need

- go slowly, you cannot just learn a bunch in a short period of time- just like ippsec said
- web academy - portswigger - burpsuite, owasp testing guide, owasp zap, hackthebox, hackthissite, play around with those, vulnhub
- for red team - detection lab
- setup your own website, server, 
- understand how to build, configure, administer
- att&ck frameworks
- build a website, put content on it - keeping notes for yourself, what ever you learned, make a note of it, make a blog
