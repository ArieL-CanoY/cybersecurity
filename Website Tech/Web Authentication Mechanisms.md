# Password
```python
- using password to authenticate users.
- first step to have other authentication mechanism such as session cookie.
```


# Cookie
```python
- creates session id that will authenticate to the server every time a request is sent.
- the cookie is stored in the server and always check if it exist when a user sent it along with its request.
```


# JWT
```python
- like cookie, the server will generate a token but it will not stored on its server, it only check if the token is valid by signing in before sending it to the user.
```



# Single Sign-On
```python
- a token that can be used to sign in to different web services without repeatedly authenticate users.
- it is used to authorized users and not authenticate.
```




# MFA - Multi-Factor Authentication
```python
- using Push Notification, SMS code send, Call to say the code, and Authenticator App.
- combination of something you know (passwords, code) and something you have (cards, token, flashdrive or physical key).
- 
```




# Passwordless
```python
- enter the email and provide the code to email for the login.
```


# Biometric Authentication
```python
- using different body parts that uniquely identify a person such as fingerprint, iris from the eye, etc
```
