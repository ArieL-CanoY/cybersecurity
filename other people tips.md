In Linux hacking and exploitation, attackers commonly manipulate various files to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious activities. Some of the most common files targeted for manipulation include:

1. Configuration Files: Attackers may modify configuration files such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/sudoers, or application-specific configuration files to escalate privileges, create backdoors, or modify access controls.
2. System Files: Critical system files like /etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.deny, /etc/rc.local, or files under /etc/init.d may be tampered with to disrupt system functionality, enable remote access, or execute unauthorized commands.
3. Log Files: Attackers manipulate log files located in /var/log/ to cover their tracks and evade detection. They can delete or modify log entries to hide malicious activities or prevent forensic analysis.
4. User Files: User-specific files, such as ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, can be targeted to gain unauthorized access, install persistent backdoors, or steal user credentials.
5. Web Server Files: For web server attacks, files like index.php, .htaccess, or web application configuration files may be modified to inject malicious code, enable remote file inclusion, or perform other web-based attacks.
6. Executable Files: Attackers may replace legitimate executable files or modify their permissions to execute malicious code with elevated privileges or install persistent malware.
7. Network Configuration Files: Network-related files such as /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* may be manipulated to enable unauthorized network access, modify routing tables, or intercept network traffic.

- Any command that runs with root privilege by a script, daemon, or init. I am not sure about what systemd does, but same likely applies.
- Any command that is suid or sgid root.
- Any file that modifies configuration for a command that runs with root privilege.
- Any file that changes how authentication works. For example, pam.conf can introduce a way to authenticate without a password.
- Any command that root users would commonly run.

  
There are too many such files and so a shortlist will not be helpful. The shell is one of them. ~/.ssh/authorized_keys is especially bad. The entire /etc should be read-only and monitored.

Ideally, the system should be locked down so hard that nothing can be written to disk. Tripwire must be deployed for production servers.
