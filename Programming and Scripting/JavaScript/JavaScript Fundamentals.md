# Variable Declaration
```javascript

>> var <variable_name> 
	- the variable and its value can be reassign 
	ex.
		var name = "Mark"; // declaration
		name = "Francis"; // allowed
		var name = "Vince"; // allowed


>> let <variable_name>
	- the value can be reassign but you cannot declare again its variable name.
	ex.
		let name = "Mark"; // declaration
		name = "Francis"; // allowed
		let name = "Vince" // not allowed
	

>> const <variable_name>
	- the name of variable and its value cannot reassign, it is fixed once it is declared, it will throw an error if reassign.
	ex.
		const name = "Mark"; // declaration
		name = "Francis"; // not allowed
		const name = "Vince" // not allowed
