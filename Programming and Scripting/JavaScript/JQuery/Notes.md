# easyui-datebox

```javascript
- here I will explain how to properly set its value to empty

> when using easyui like datebox, to set its value to empty or null, use its function "datebox" ex. "mydate.datebox('setValue', '')", because if we use "mydate.val('')", it will not let it put its value again, unless you use the "datebox" function.
