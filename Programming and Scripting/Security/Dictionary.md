# ReDOS
```
Stands for Regular Expression Denial-Of-Service.

A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp), is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. 


A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) is an algorithmic complexity attack that produces a denial-of-service by providing a regular expression and/or an input that takes a long time to evaluate.


Examples of Evil Regex:

(a+)+
([a-zA-Z]+)*
(a|aa)+
(a|a?)+
(.*a){x} for x \> 10
```
