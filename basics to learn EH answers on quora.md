What are the basic things one should have to learn about ethical hacking?

](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-basic-things-one-should-have-to-learn-about-ethical-hacking?no_redirect=1)

You should firstly start learning with :-

Linux (e.g kali, parrot, tails,…etc)

Web based languages :- php, html, css, bootstrap, AJAX

SQL for accessing databases

C, c++, Python,ruby,pearl…etc

Deep knowledge on Networking OSI Model and TCP/IP model and gateways, packets, Encapsulation and much more

Cryptography and various encryption standards like md5, blowfish, RC4,…etc and about encoding and decoding.

Knowledge about. Steganography

Various Protocols like http,https,ftp,ssl,arp,rip,smtp,ppp,…etc

About various attacks like XSS attack, sql injection, man-in-the-middle, buffer overflow, CSRF,…etc

Various hacking tools (e.g nmap, acunetix,wireshark…etc)

Learn metaspoilt

Social Engineering (e. g Phishing, and ability to manipulate others. If victim's brain is not secure than everything can be exploited)

Ability to learn new things

Learn until your death

In last,

Security is just an illusion…

I hope you would like my answer…

Thank You…

How do I learn ethical hacking?

](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-ethical-hacking?no_redirect=1)

Ok I will repeat what I have written in more than some 10 answers.

If you are really serious about perusing career in computer system securities forget all about ethical hacking now. Ethical hacking is a jimick designed to attract rip of and make people feel they have learned something when they have not.

Most people think that security hacking is a specific course or thing that they can learn separately when it is really not. Security hacking skill is an art form that is developed by long term practice learning and hard work. It is not something that can be easily be learned out from a text book and a course.

Sure they will teach you to use a few tools and few concepts and few methods that has been outdated for maybe 20 years but to really learn the art you need to master how a computer system works.

Imagine a guy who knows everything about a car, he knows how the engine is made and works he knows the transmissions, he knows the suspension systems he knows why each screw in the car is there and what changing it can do to the car. Now if he tries he can open the door without triggering the alarm, there is no question of it, he can hot wire the car, change its engines performance, modify almost anything and even remove every security feature in it.

This is how being a hacker feels like, being so good and knowledgeable about the system that you can practically modify any aspect of it to your needs. Its not just getting over security but changing stuff, creating new stuff and even inventing new technologies. It all comes down to how well you understand the system.

To become a good hacker you need to start learning how a computer works rather than how to hack into a system. Yo need to start with basic programming and scripting, learn it well and understand the possibilities, then move on to HTTP servers such as Apache and HTTP by itself, learn how servers handle request, how message goes from one side to another, how is the security stuff implemented, where is the passwords stored, can it be read. Starting their it is a very long journey to becoming the next best hacker, you slowly learn to think like a computer and understand the system even better. The more you understand how a security is implemented and what are its weaknesses the better you will eb at exploiting it.

Ethical hacking courses that are provided today are more like a course to hot wiring, there is no guarantee you will ever get into the car, you will never know what to do if the car has an alarm, you will never even know what to do if hot wiring do not work.

So not it is your decision, there is no such thing as "Hacking" or "Ethical hacking" its an art that comes from the knowledge of the working of the machine. Learn it build it break it.

How can I become a good ethical hacker?

](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-a-good-ethical-hacker)

In order to become a good hacker, ethical or no, you need to know programming, operating systems and networking. Start with one of those three depending on what you want to hack.

Let’s say for example you want to hack websites. The first thing you need to do is learn to code websites if yoy want to be any good. Don’t even think about hacking yet. Start with a full-stack PHP framework. Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Learn about the OSI model, especially the application layer protocols too. But build websites with client-server applications or network-based applications. Do that for six months at least and then (and only then) will you be able to be able to hack websites. Otherwise you won’t get very far. If you don’t like learning to code for fun and if you don’t like learning how stuff works, you cannot ever be any kind of hacker. In this case purchase a Udemy course on full-stack web development and start learning.

Another example is if you want to hack wireless networks, VoIP, wireless devices, Bluetooth, etc. Research wireless networking. Look up on YouTube computer networking and see if you like what you are learning about them maybe buy books on computer networking which exist. Maybe you could buy The TCP/IP Guide or maybe a book on CISCO networking. Maybe get a Udemy course on Network+. Work on it for a long time but learn how networks work, especially networking protocols but learn everything you can about how they work not just protocols. Once you get basic computer networking skill only then you will be able to learn to attack 802.11, Ethernet, Bluetooth, etc. networks.

If you want to exploit operating systems then you need to learn how operating systems work. You can get manuals on just about any operating system and yes OS X and MacOS are just as easy to hack as Windows or Linux and Apple knows it and Apple even has a bug bounty program (which I will talk about soon for you). Once you know how operating systems work and have sufficient experience working with them, only then will you be able to learn to exploit them.

After you do that, and only after you do that, go to Udemy hacking courses, get hacking books, go for online tutorials on hacking etc.

To be extremely good it’s always ideal to have a specialty, but still be well-rounded. What I mean is there’s no way to know everything about everything. You need to have an area of hacking you like most. Different areas include:

Web hacking - exploiting flaws in web application code to get usernames and passwords, give a thousand upvotes on a website when you are only are allowed to give one, defacing websites, and a whole lot more

Mobile app hacking exploiting flaws in mobile application code; similar to web hacking but where you plug your smartphone into your computer and actually attack the applications on your phone from the computer, like hacking Snapchat or WhatsApp messages for example

Wireless hacking - finding a way to break into a car and control via Bluetooth as opposed to hot wiring, hacking a router for a WiFi password maybe even hacking an iPhone or desktop that is on the same network as you or performing a man-in-the-middle attack to get the web history of someone on the same network as you

Internet of Things hacking - combo of wireless hacking and hardware hacking that allows you to hack a smart fridge, thermostat, Bluetooth connection of a car, someone’s smartwatch, and loads of other devices

Reverse engineering - breaking software apart to see the assembly level code, not the original source code, then exploiting that assembly code in order to get something to happen that the original programmer didn’t intend to happen; this one is useful combined with web hacking, mobile app hacking, or even operating system and server exploitation

Operating system and server exploitation involves exploiting flaws in the operating system of either a normal client computer or even a server in order to get access to that person’s files, documents, etc. stored on their hard drive

Hardware hacking - taking hardware apart and modifying it, putting it back together a different way, and reusing it for something it wasn’t intended to do; can be combined with wireless hacking to help gain access to companies’ networks or even their private devices

Hacking using a programming language to make your own tools - this one you can start building your own tools when gainsome skill but is more to help you in the areas of hacking you study

There are other areas of having too but those are some of the more common ones.

Once you know how stuff works, then get Kali Linux or whatever Linux OS you want and learn. But have one area of interest. Be especially well practiced in one or two areas, but know the basics of several.

But keep repeating the process of learning how stuff works, then learning to hack that stuff. When you are good at several but have two or three chosen areas you are especially good at, then you can get a job as an ethical hacker and be good at it.

The quintessential areas of hacking are: WiFi hacking, network hacking, web hacking, reverse engineering, server exploitation, exploit development, and programming (most important one), social engineering, etc

Some additional areas you can learn are mobile application hacking, iOS hacking, Android OS hacking, Open source intelligence, different sub areas of reverse engineering (browser hacking, operating system reverse engineering, video game hacking, etc), database hacking (because you can go further than just what’s required for web hacking in terms of being an expert at database hacking, advanced VoIP hacking, hardware hacking, CISCO device hacking, Juniper device hacking, cryptography, and many many more…
